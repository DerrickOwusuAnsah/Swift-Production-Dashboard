Driving Entertainment with Data | SwiftShip Production Dashboard ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š
***********
I worked on a project to explore the performance of a fictional entertainment company called SwiftShip Production. The goal was to understand how data can be used to tell the story of growth in the movie and television industry.

The dashboard revealed that the company has produced more than 9,600 titles since 1920. A majority of these are television shows, which form over eighty per cent of the catalogue, while movies make up the remaining share. Drama and Comedy clearly dominate as the leading genres, demonstrating the companyâ€™s strength in connecting with audiences through storytelling and entertainment.

The ratings data show that the largest share of titles caters to the thirteen-plus and eighteen-plus categories, reflecting both family-oriented content and productions designed for mature audiences. What stood out most is the substantial global footprint of SwiftShip, with shows created across different countries, demonstrating how the brand has become international in scope.

Another interesting aspect is the dashboardâ€™s interactivity. I introduced a slicer [as shown in image 2] that allows C-level executives and managers to filter results by country and by release year. It slides out smoothly when clicked and hides again with the arrow icon [shown in image 1], keeping the design clean while still offering flexibility for deeper exploration.

This project reinforces how dashboards go beyond numbers. They provide a narrative of impact, legacy and growth. SwiftShip Productionâ€™s journey from its first release in 1920 to the sharp rise in content after the year 2000 illustrates how data can help us see both history and future potential in a single view.
